=================

Whenever I need to list files and folder on my server I symlink the index.php in this repo and it works.

It's "recursive" so if you click on a folder it will be shown in the page.

Image are provided by http://cdn.sigerr.org/assets but obviously this URL is meant to be changed if you use this 'project'.

## Screenshot

This is basically what you get.

## Special feature

- *Wordpress*: If a folder is recognized as a wordpress folder it will display the version

## Todo

- Make it responsive (only iphone/desktop)
- create correct link for files when directory depth > 1
